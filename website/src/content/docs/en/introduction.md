# PromptHub

An open-source AI Prompt & Skill management tool. Manage your prompts and SKILL.md skills, one-click install to Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, Qoder, CodeBuddy and 15+ mainstream AI coding tools.

## Key Features

### 🧩 Skill Management (v0.7.1)

Built-in store with 20+ curated AI agent skills. One-click install to 15+ platforms. Local scan discovers existing SKILL.md files. Supports Symlink/copy modes, per-platform target directory overrides, AI translation, and tag filtering.
