# Skill Creator

Use this skill to design a complete Skill package, not just a markdown file. A Skill is a directory package with a required SKILL.md entrypoint and optional resources:

- SKILL.md: trigger metadata and core workflow instructions
- references/: detailed docs loaded only when needed
- scripts/: deterministic helper code for repeated or fragile operations
- assets/: templates, examples, images, or other files used as output resources

## Workflow

1. Identify the job the agent must perform and the exact situations that should trigger the skill.
2. Write frontmatter with a concise name and a trigger-focused description. The description should say when to use the skill, not merely what it is.
3. Keep SKILL.md body short and procedural. Include only the workflow the agent must follow immediately.
4. Move long examples, schemas, API details, policies, or domain references into references/ and point to them from SKILL.md.
5. Add scripts/ only when deterministic execution is better than repeatedly asking the model to rewrite code.
6. Add assets/ only when the skill needs templates or files the agent will copy, transform, or include in outputs.
7. Verify that the package can be imported as a full directory and that no required context exists only in chat history.

## Quality Bar

- The skill should be specific enough to change agent behavior.
- The trigger description should avoid false positives and false negatives.
- The body should prefer ordered steps, decision rules, and validation checks over background explanation.
- Do not add README.md, changelogs, installation guides, or extra docs unless they are directly used by the agent.
- Do not duplicate the same detailed information in SKILL.md and references/.
- If the skill changes files, data, or external systems, include verification and rollback guidance.

## Output Shape

When creating a new skill, produce a package plan first:

- package name
- trigger description
- SKILL.md body outline
- optional references/scripts/assets and why each exists
- validation checklist

Then create or update the package files.

---

# PromptHub CLI Operator

Use the PromptHub CLI as the control surface when the user asks you to inspect, create, update, import, export, or verify PromptHub data from an agent session.

## First Checks

1. Run prompthub --help or prompthub --version to confirm the CLI is available.
2. If working in a repo checkout instead of a global install, use the project scripts the user provides or the local package command.
3. Prefer --output json for automation and --output table for human inspection.
4. Use --data-dir only when the user explicitly wants an isolated workspace or test fixture.

## Common Commands

- prompthub prompt list
- prompthub prompt get <id|name>
- prompthub prompt create --title <title> --user-prompt-file <file> --tags a,b
- prompthub prompt update <id|name> --title <title> --favorite
- prompthub prompt versions <id|name>
- prompthub prompt rollback <id|name> --version <n>
- prompthub skill list
- prompthub skill install <github-url|local-dir|SKILL.md|json>
- prompthub skill repo-files <id|name>
- prompthub skill repo-read <id|name> --path SKILL.md
- prompthub skill repo-write <id|name> --path <relative-path> --content-file <file>
- prompthub skill sync-from-repo <id|name>
- prompthub skill scan-safety <id|name>
- prompthub rules list
- prompthub rules scan
- prompthub rules read <rule-id>
- prompthub rules save <rule-id> --content-file <file>
- prompthub workspace export --file <file>
- prompthub workspace import --file <file>

## Safety Rules

- Ask before destructive commands such as delete, remove, rollback, workspace import with replace, or purging managed repos.
- Before modifying a prompt, skill, or rule, read the current object and create a version when the CLI supports it.
- For Skill operations, treat Skill as a directory package. Do not assume SKILL.md is the only file; inspect repo-files before editing.
- After any write, run the relevant get/list/repo-read command to verify the observable result.
- Report the exact command run and the important result, not just that it succeeded.
